## Description ##
A Plugin for WordPress that allows you to define roles for members within an organization, such as President, Secretary, etc. 
Useful if the website is for a society or organization and the members are able to log in and update their profile etc.

Note that the roles are separate from any role the member may have in terms of access to the website (subscriber, editor, etc).
The plugin also supports additional fields in the user profile.

## Installation ##
**NB:** This plugin requires PHP version 3.4 or higher! 

Upload the members-list folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Add the shortcode to the page or post you'd like to display the members list.

You're all set!.
